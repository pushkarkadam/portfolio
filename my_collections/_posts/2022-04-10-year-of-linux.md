excerpt: Through various circumstances since last year, I used Ubuntu as my primary operating system. This blog outlines my experience of using Linux for day-to-day tasks and how I have realised that the operating system doesn't matter as long as you can get your work done.

Ever so often, one encounters the question: Mac or PC?

While both of these types of computers and their operating systems (OS) have specific use cases, one often forgets the unsung hero of the operating system: Linux.

Last year, for the first time, I downloaded Ubuntu OS, a Linux distribution, and decided to make it my primary OS. This blog is about how I did all the tasks I would typically do on a Mac or PC on Ubuntu and the challenges I encountered.

## What is Linux?
---

Linux is an operating system (OS) like Windows OS or macOS. It is one of the most popular OS in the world. Android, one of the most popular OS on the smartphone, is powered by Linux.

## Why use Linux?
---

This experience was not to create a blog or some internet challenges such as "I used Linux for a year, and this happened" or "10 things I learned from using Linux for a year. Number 7 will surprise you." This experience was, as Bob Ross would say, a happy accident.

Before starting my university, I purchased a Macbook Air with 256 GB of SSD. I was planning to use this computer for my two years course. Then, I learned that I had to use Windows OS for some engineering software. One option was to dual boot my Mac with Windows. I did not wish to do that because I was afraid that I would exhaust my storage space. So, I purchased a new HP laptop with Windows OS. I must have used this HP computer only for a semester or two for some specific subjects, and most of the time, it remained in my closet for two years after graduation. So, a year ago, I decided that I would recycle this computer. At the same time, my Macbook started giving me warning messages every few minutes that I had nearly exhausted my storage space (Remember 256 GB of SSD?). Therefore, using Macbook meant that I would constantly deal with error messages and conservatively use my storage space.

With all the issues with Macbook, especially while coding, I knew that I had to buy a new computer. At the time, buying a new computer didn't make sense to me as I was trying to get rid of the old things. At this time, I tried to switch on the HP laptop and crossed my fingers to see if it would even startup. It did!

I have used Windows OS for so long that I wanted to change the OS. So, I installed Ubuntu 20.04 and decided to make this my primary computer for coding. At that time, I just wanted to separate my work from my leisure time on my computer, so it meant that I would use Ubuntu for work and Mac for leisure activities. But, after a few months, I got irritated by the constant error messages regarding full memory, and this was when I switched to Ubuntu for all purposes.

## What about day to day tasks?
---

I have used the Chrome web browser to complete most of my admin tasks for the past several years. My emails, task planner, calendar, and even entertainment happen on my browser. So, in a way, all I need is a chrome web browser, and I can complete most of my tasks and receive my dose of entertainment with Netflix and Spotify, both available on the web platform.

When it comes to the word processor and spreadsheet software, I started using LibreOffice, which provides a software suite for word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation. Of course, this software group is not as adequate as Microsoft's Office suite. But, recently, Microsoft started developing their Office suite for Linux. But, if one still wants another option, one can use Google's software such as Google Docs, Google Sheet, and Google Slides.

## What about software development?
---

I, specifically, shifted to Linux because of software development. Not that I couldn't have done software development on Windows or Mac, but I have always found software development on Linux a pleasant experience. One particular thing I enjoyed about coding on Ubuntu was using Terminal for every programming language. Also, all my favourite IDEs are available on Linux.

## What I couldn't do on Linux?
---

I wanted to work on computer-aided design (CAD) models. All the companies that provide industry-standard CAD software do not provide the software for Linux. But, there is a way around it. I used FreeCAD, open-source software available on all the OS. This software is not as user-friendly or powerful as other industry-standard software such as SolidWorks or Fusion 360, but it still gets the essential work done. But, both SolidWorks and Fusion 360 have a web-based framework. So, technically, one can still use the industry-standard CAD software on Linux.

## Concluding Thoughts
---

I used Linux out of necessity and curiosity, and it has now become my go-to OS. Sure, sometimes, simple installation of software can be a bit complex procedure, but in the end, things work, and there is a friendly community that helps and supports the users. Sometimes, I am irritated because I cannot do some tasks on Ubuntu OS, but I usually find a way around doing it.

The OS does not matter after using computers for so long and being glued in front of the computer for more than twelve hours a day. At this point, I am happy with whichever OS can help me get my job done.

So, to answer the age-old question: Mac or PC (or Ubuntu)? My answer is simple: whatever gets the work done!
