This blog post is going to be a short update about the blogs. Over the years, I used external blogging platforms such as Blogger, WordPress, and Medium. However, last year, I felt a need to own the contents of my blog, where I had complete control over its layout, format, and type of content. Thankfully, I found Jekyll, a static site generator that transforms the plain-text files into a website.

With the help of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), I was able to write blogs in Markdown language and automatically generate web pages. [GitHub pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) helped with the hosting of this blog website. The philosophy behind this decision was to maintain my knowledge base that is sustainable to migrate anywhere else in the future. However, this blog website resulted from me following some Jekyll tutorials on YouTube, where I understood very little what was going on. More than half the things were a black box for me. I only had an empirical understanding regarding how to make it work.

Fast forward a year from creating my first Jekyll site, I learned about the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework. I found some similarities between Jekyll and Django. I started following [Jekyll tutorials](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) and understood how amazing it is to create a website while avoiding the frustration of coding everything while using only HTML and CSS. I used the newly acquired knowledge of Jekyll to create a portfolio website which was already long overdue. While understanding the inside out of Jekyll, it seemed logical to have a blog page integrated with my portfolio to avoid maintaining two different websites. Voila! My foresight to control the contents of my blogs proved prudent. I was effortlessly able to migrate all my blogs to the new portfolio website.

All the past blogs from my previous blogging website are now available on this new portfolio website, and any new blog post will be only available on this website henceforth. I do not know if this will be the last blog migration, as with new knowledge and need, I may have a different format in the future. For now, as per my needs, this seems the most logical option.
