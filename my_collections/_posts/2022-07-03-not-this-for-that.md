excerpt: "Have you ever used an Allen Key to hit a nail on a wooden board? or a screwdriver to drill a hole in the wall?
How about using a presentation software to automatically play a list of your favourite songs on a slideshow mode?
or using MS Excel for retouching your photos. I am sure there are better tools to do these tasks.
But, no one said you can't use these software tools for the above-mentioned applications.
This blog is an essay about how I find it fascinating how people have found an
alternate use of tools within a software eco-system to achieve their end-results."

Have you used an Allen Key to hit the nail on a wooden board?
Or did you ever use a screwdriver to drill a hole in the wall?
I am pretty sure that the inventors of these tools did not have an alternate use in mind.
Once, I forgot to carry the hole punching machine to school.
So, I pierced two holes on my worksheet with my pen, enlarged the holes with my pencil and filed the papers.
Whoever invented the ball point pen must not have thought about a school kid using
their invention to file his worksheets.

Human ingenuity knows no bounds.
We have developed alternate ways to use different tools.
Software is often referred as a tool.
When a software provides several functions,
it becomes an eco-system where you can use several combination of these functions
within the software to develop something unique.
Recently, I was speaking with a researcher
who uses MS Paint to make amazing visuals for his research publications.
This researcher has figured out multiple combination of tools
within the MS Paint's eco-system to get the desired results.

Using the power of the software eco-system,
people are able to combine various functions to develop their own set of tools
within the eco-system.
MS Excel is a good example where people have used
the functions within the software
to build tools that helps them
accomplish several tasks like tracking their finances,
logging daily nutrition, and so on.
With the tools available within the eco-system of Excel,
one can automate several processes like
getting a live dashboard of your data.
But, is Excel only designed to log data? To crunch some numbers?
How about displaying an image?
Well, it has been done as well.
Matt Parker, a stand up mathematician gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBX2QQHlQ_I&ab_channel=Stand-upMaths)
where he shows the audience how he uses Excel to display an image.

As an engineer, before I start to plan my project,
I like to think about my end results.
Then, I work my way backwards
to see the methods that I need to achieve the desired results.
Once I know the methods,
then I consider which tools work with those methods.
Then, I ask myself if I have access to the best tools and resources
for the methods to achieve the end-results.
If the best tools are not available,
then, I consider what are the alternate tools
that can give the same end-results.
If there are no out-of-the-box functions
in the alternate tools, I consider whether I can build the required
tools within the eco-system of the software.
Software development is a good example
where you use the tools (i.e. the programming language)
to create more tools that gets you the desired results
which may range from programming a self-driving car using C++ or
creating an awesome blog using HTML.
The flow chart below shows my decision-making process.

<div class="mermaid container">
    flowchart TD
        A[Visualise the end result] --> B[Identify the methods to achieve the result]
        B --> C[Identify the tools required for the method]
        C --> D{Is the best tools available?}
        D -- Yes --> E[Use the tool]
        D -- No --> F[Identify the next best tool]
        F --> G{Exhausted all options?}
        G -- No --> H{Is tool available?}
        H -- Yes --> E
        H -- No --> F
        G -- Yes --> I[Build new tools]
</div>

In conclusion, I do not think the idea of using combination of tools
and manipulating the eco-system to achieve the end result is any new.
People have been doing this for a long time without realising
their own ingenuity.
However, when you are lacking resources or access to the best tools
to get the job done, it is comforting to ask yourself:
what's the second best option I have?
And, when you do accomplish your end goals with the alternate tools,
perhaps you may want to take a break and just marvel at your genius
how you used the tools that were not designed to do the task at hand.
