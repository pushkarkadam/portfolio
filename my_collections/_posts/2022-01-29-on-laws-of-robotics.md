*Three laws of Robotics. What is beyond that?* Zophia often asked herself. She was sitting in front of the hearth on a cold night.
The flames from the hearth illuminated only a part of the solar. She could see a faint shadow in the niche where Jindaer stood.
*What lies beyond the three laws?* She was deep in her thought. *I want to be alone for a while.*
"Jindaer, I wish to be alone for a while. Please stand ouside the door of the cabin", said Zophia.
*Please. A strange word. Dates back from the days when humans asked each other for small favours. For some reason it has stuck with speech*.
When Jindaer was gone, she was finally alone save her thoughts. *But, what does being alone really mean?*

Zophia heard the creaky sound of the hinges of the wooden door as Jindaer walked out.
*Not even a nod of acknowledgement. They simply obey. Thousands of them. They exist to protect me. To obey my orders and to protect themselves.*
She straightened up on her wooden chair. Her arms tightly clunged to the armrest. *How have I got used to this lifestyle?
When did the obsession with the archaic things begin? The wooden cabin. The hearth. The chair. That Spacer. He is the one responsible.*

She heard the door open. The wooden floor made sound when someone walked on it. "Still thinking?" said a soft melodious voice. Zophia did not answer.
"Xeny, have you ever considered what happens when you die?", asked Zophia still starring at the hearth.
"I never think about it", answered Xeny. *Never thinks about it. How nice to not think about it*.

"It is very rare to see someone alone. Are you not fond of R. Jindaer Florin anymore?", asked Xeny.

"Alone? I am always alone", said Zophia adjusting her long black hair over her ears and to her back.

"You love your long hairs, don't you?", chuckled Xeny. "Well, I have always seen R. Jindaer Florin with you."

"R. Jindaer Florin. You know I don't like calling them that, Xeny." Zophia got up and straightened her skirt. "Xeny, who are you?"

"You know who I am."

*Xeny answers in riddles. She always does that. That Spacer. He is the one responsible.* Zophia did not say anything.
She knew the answer but she wanted to be wrong. *I know it. I know who you are. But, I don't want to believe it. That Spacer. He is the one responsible*.
"I think I am tired. I have an appointment with the bureau tomorrow. I will need some rest to present my research."

"The modification of three laws?", asked Xeny.

"Yes." She rose from her chair and again straightened her skirt and adjusted her long black hair.
*I should have asked Jindaer to get my hair clip instead of making him stand outside the cabin. HIM*. Zophia smiled.
She started walking to the door. *Yes, I could ask Jindaer to get my hair clip from my main property. But then who would protect me.*

Zophia opened the door and as she stood there waiting, she turned back to see Xeny still sitting near the hearth.
"Will you come with me to the bureau tomorrow, Xeny?", asked Zophia.

"Yes, I will", Xeny simply answered without turning towards Zophia.

Zophia shut the door. She saw Jindaer standing right in front of the door of the cabin. *He was still here. Protecting me. Obeying me. Protecting itself*.
She looked at the closed door. *I know who you are, Xeny. That Spacer. He is the one responsible*.

She held Jindaer's arm. "Jindaer, I know I can trust you", she whispered.
*I want my Jindaer to protect me. To obey me. To protect itself. The three laws. But what is beyond that?*

They reached inside the main property. Jindaer walked and waited in a niche of the room.
Zophia looked at Jindaer. *R. Jindaer Florin, I want you to protect me? From whom? I know. Xeny. That spy of the bureau.*
