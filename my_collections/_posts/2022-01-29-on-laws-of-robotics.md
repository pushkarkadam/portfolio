*Three laws of Robotics. What lies beyond the three laws?* Zophia often asked herself this question. She was sitting in front of the hearth in a wooden cabin.
The flames from the hearth illuminated only a part of the cabin. She could see a faint shadow in the niche where Jindaer stood.
*What lies beyond the three laws?* She was deep in her thoughts. *I want to be alone for a while.*
"Jindaer, I wish to be alone for a while. Please stand outside the door of the cabin", said Zophia.
*Please. A strange word. Dates back from the days when humans asked each other for small favours. For some reason it has stuck with speech. With Jindaer gone, I will be alone. But, what does being alone really mean?*

Zophia heard the creaky sound of the hinges of the wooden door as Jindaer walked out and there there was a sound of the door slamming.
*Not even a nod of acknowledgement. They simply obey. Thousands of them working on my estate and millions on this planet. They exist to protect me, to obey my orders, and to protect themselves.*
She straightened up on her wooden chair. Her arms tightly clunged to the armrest. *How have I got used to this lifestyle?
When did the obsession with the archaic things begin? The wooden cabin. The hearth. The chair. The long skirt. The long hairs tied with an ancient hair clip. That Spacer. He is the one responsible.*

She heard the door open. The sound of the footsteps on the wooden floor was not loud enough to disturb her thoughts.
"Still thinking?" said a soft melodious voice.
"Xeny, have you ever considered what happens when you die?", asked Zophia while still staring at the hearth.
"I choose not think about it", answered Xeny. *You choose not to think about it or you cannot think about it. Such a cold response. Am I still alone?*

"It is very rare to see someone alone", said Xeny.

"Alone?", Zophia trembled. "I...uh...am am always alone." Zophia adjusted her strands of her long black hair over her ears and combed them with her fingers to her back and tied them in a knot.

"You love your long hairs, don't you?", chuckled Xeny while playing with a strand of her short blond hair. "Well, I have never seen you alone. You always have R. Jindaer Florin with you, don't you?"

"R. Jindaer Florin? Xeny, you know I don't like using *that* prefix for Jindaer." Zophia got up and straightened her long brown skirt. She pulled up the sleeves upto her elbow of her black coloured upper garment which had a close fitted collar that covered her neck. She looked at Xeny's face shining bright from the light coming from the hearth. *Xeny is dexterous, poised, and beautiful beyond measure*. Zophia glanced in her deep blue eyes and asked, "Xeny, who are you?"

"You know who I am", answered Xeny. Her comely smile spanned her face while her deep blue eyes pierced Zophia's dark brown eyes.

*Xeny answers in riddles. She always does that. Her eyes show that she knows what I am thinking. That Spacer. He is the one responsible.* Zophia did not say anything. *I know who you are, Xeny. But, I hope I am wrong. That Spacer. He is the one responsible*.
"I think I am tired. I have an appointment with the Bureau tomorrow. I will need some rest before I present my research."

"The modification of the three laws?", asked Xeny.

"Uh...yes." *I never told her about modification*. Zophia pulled down her sleeves of her upper garment to cover her arms up to her wrists and untied her long black hair which flowed on her back with the ends almost reaching her waist.
*I should have asked Jindaer to get my hair clip from the bungalow instead of making him stand outside the cabin. HIM*. Zophia smirked.
She started walking to the door. *Yes, I could have asked Jindaer to get my hair clip from the bungalow. But then, who would have protected me? I would really be alone. I don't want to be alone*.

Zophia opened the door and as she stood there thinking, she turned back to see Xeny still sitting on the wooden chair, facing the hearth.
"Xeny, will you accompany me to the Bureau tomorrow?", asked Zophia.

"Yes, I will", Xeny answered while her back still faced Zophia.

Zophia shut the door. She saw Jindaer standing right in front of the door of the cabin. *He stands exactly where I ordered him to stand. Protecting me. Obeying me. Protecting himself*.
She looked at the closed door. *I know who you are, Xeny. That Spacer. He is the one responsible*.

She interlocked her arm with Jindaer's arm while they walked to her bungalow. "Jindaer, I know I can trust you", she whispered.
*I want my Jindaer to protect me. To obey me. To protect himself. The three laws. But what lies beyond the three laws?*

They entered the bungalow. Jindaer separated from Zophia and walked to one of the nine niches in her main room.
Zophia looked at Jindaer who stood quietly in the niche waiting for her orders. *R. Jindaer Florin, I want you to protect me, obey me, and protect yourself. I know who you are, Xeny. I know what you are.*
