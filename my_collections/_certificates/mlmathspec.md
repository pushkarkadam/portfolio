A sequence of 3 courses on the prerequisite mathematics for
applications in data science and machine learning. Successful
participants learn how to represent data in a linear algebra
context and manipulate these objects mathematically. They are
able to summarise properties of data sets and map them onto
lower dimensional spaces with principal component analysis.
Finally they can solve optimisation problems and use this skill to
train models for describing data such as simple neural networks.
