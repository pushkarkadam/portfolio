Conducted research on possible methods to analyse and create a predictive model on the available data.

Key Features of the project:

Predictive analysis of the blast-induced vibration on the data procured by YIN Zuoming et al. (2015).

Introduced Back Propagation algorithm to train the Neural Network in MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox to reduce the percentage of average error of prediction.
