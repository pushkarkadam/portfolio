Designed a preliminary system to automate the process of inspection of a car entering a garage.

Key features of the project:

Designed a licence plate recognition system using computer vision and machine learning to identify the licence plate of the car. Also, tested the algorithm on the prototype of the system.

Designed a control system to automatically capture the image of the car with three camera modules triggered by the sensors integrated with the microcontroller.

Created an automatic storage system of the images of the car from different camera modules and store them in a directory referenced with the license plate number.
