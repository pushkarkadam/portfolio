Computer vision and image processing are playing a vital role in the design of mobile robots and autonomous driving vehicle. This project aims at using computer vision to detect the lanes on the road.

The project was designed in Python using the computer vision and image processing library OpenCV. The code was tested on different types of images and finally incorporated on the video. The key features of the project are the use of different image processing techniques and the use of 'region of interest' (ROI) to concentrate on the image of the road and to reduce the noise in the image.
